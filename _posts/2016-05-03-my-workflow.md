title: My workflow. How I moved to Vim
permalink: /workflow

Since I started my developer career, I have always been using powerful tools
like RubyMine or Webstorm in my regular workflow.  They were providing me with
comfortable environment and I liked embedded Git client very much. But there was
a problem...

Because of the fact that I am using more than one computer in my work, it
becomes very hard to keep the same environment on both of them.  If I tweak it
somehow on one machine, I have to repeat this process on another. It takes time
and diverts me from doing my job.  And it concerns editors and IDEs too.

So I started looking for a solution.

## Solution 1

I was thinking about some place, accessible from any computer (or at least
computers I work with) and I came up with an idea to use VPS with installed VNC
server and xfce on it, to which I can connect remotely. At first glance it
sounded as a reasonable idea, but ultimately this solution did not for me work at all.

So I gave up this option.

## Solution 2

And then I asked myself why can't I work with the same VPS, but right inside the
terminal. I don't have to have all those modern and fancy editors to effectively
work with code. So I decided to try and learn vim. I already used vim from time
to time and I knew very few basic commands. I still used to think vim was a
super hardcore editor too hard to use. But I was curious enough to inverstigate
why.
