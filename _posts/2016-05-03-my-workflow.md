title: My workflow. How I moved to Vim

Since I started my developer career, I have always been using powerful tools like RubyMine or Webstorm in my regular workflow.
They were providing me with comfortable environment and I liked embedded Git client very much. But there was a problem...

Because of the fact that I am using more than one computer in my work, it becomes very hard to keep the same environment on both of them.
If I tweak it somehow on one machine, I have to repeat this process on another. It takes time and diverts me from doing my job.
And it concerns editors and IDEs too.

So I started looking for a solution.

## The solution

Coming soon...
